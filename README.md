<h2>  A small step for man, a big step for immortality.</h2>

<p>
  Imagine a mobile app where you can directly store information about your ideas, your dreams, your problems, your experiences and everything that goes through your head.
<br>
   That you can at any time and very easily come back, modify them, erase them, connect them, share them, transmit some of them to a member of your family, a colleague or a friend...
<br>
  Would not you be an augmented man or woman, with your second brain, a digital brain this time?
<br>
  Imagine that you can connect this digital brain to other similar brains...
<br>

  To that of your neighbors to agree on a specific point or that of your colleagues to take into account their expertise after they have shared access to you.
<br>

  Expose to your family or to anyone who wants to help you advance your projects, your worldview, your children your values and your experience...
</p>

<ul>
<li>Transfer of knowledge during retirement,</li>
<li>Collaboration in real time,</li>
<li>Connect to Wikipedia and to a growing number of scientific knowledge bases and other fields (food, botany...),</li>
<li>Bi-directional exchanges with connected objects and robots (information directly understandable and inferable by machines).</li>
</ul>
