## Intro

<p> <i> Translated </i> (fr -> en) </p>

<h3>  A small step for man, a big step for immortality.</h3>

<p>
  Imagine an app where you can easily store information about your ideas, your dreams, your problems, your experiences and everything that goes through your head.
<br><br>
  Then simply modify them, erase them, connect them, share them, transmit some of them to a member of your family, a colleague or a friend...
<br><br>
  Would not you be an augmented person, with new brain, a digital brain this time?
<br><br>
  Imagine that you can connect this digital brain to other similar brains...
<br><br>
  Share with colleagues to take into account of their expertise after they have shared access to you.
<br><br>
  Allow people to help you advance your projects, your worldview, your values and your experience...
</p>

<ul>
<li> Knowledge transfer,</li>
<li> Collaborate in real time,</li>
<li> Connect to Wikipedia or a growing number of scientific knowledge bases and other fields (food, botany...),</li>
<li> Bi-directional exchanges with connected objects and robots (information directly understandable and inferable by machines).</li>
</ul>
